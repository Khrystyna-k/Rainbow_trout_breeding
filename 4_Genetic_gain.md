# The expected genetic gain (ΔG) for increased body weight was computed using the breeder’s equation (Falconer & Mackay, Citation1996):

$$ΔG = (r ×𝑖×𝜎𝛼)/𝐿$$

where 𝑟TI is selection accuracy, i is the selection intensity, 𝜎𝛼 the square root of additive genetic variance, and L is the generation interval in years.


# The realized genetic gain was computed considering the estimates across all families as shown in the section above realized gains
