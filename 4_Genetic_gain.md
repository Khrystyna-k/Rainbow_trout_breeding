# The expected genetic gain (ΔG) for increased body weight was computed using the breeder’s equation (Falconer & Mackay, 1996):
```{r}
ΔG = (r × i × σα) / L

where 𝑟TI is selection accuracy, i is the selection intensity, 𝜎𝛼 the square root of additive genetic variance, and L is the generation interval in years.
```

# The realized genetic gain was computed considering the estimates across all families
